            We are a team of javascript educators working to give our students
            the opportunity for a full time job in Javascript. We use these
            systems to manage our campuses faster than the speed of light.
            Because pair programming across an eight to twenty minute
            interplanetary ping is just painful. Boy are we going to be doing a
            lot of caching in the future. Seriously.
